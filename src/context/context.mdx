# context

`useContext` was added to `React` in version 16.8, released 2019.

Before that, you had to use the `<MyContext.Consumer>` render-prop API to read from a context.

useContext was one of the first built-in hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext, etc.) added in 16.8.

The purpose of useContext is to read values from a React Context directly inside a function component,
without needing to pass props down manually or use the `<Context.Consumer>` render-prop.

## Why it matters

1. Avoids prop drilling (passing props through layers of components that don’t need them).
2. Simplifies code — one line instead of a render-prop wrapper.
3. Auto-subscribes to the context, so the component re-renders when the value changes.

## Example

### Before hooks (render prop):
```jsx
<MyContext.Consumer>
    {value => <p>{value}</p>}
</MyContext.Consumer>
```

### With useContext:
```jsx
const value = useContext(MyContext);
return <p>{value}</p>;
```
