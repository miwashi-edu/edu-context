# foundation

In most React/FE project structures, a foundation/ **directory** is used for things that are `core building blocks` of the
application — pieces that everything else depends on, but that don’t depend on higher-level “features.”

Think of it as the **base layer** in a layered architecture.

---
### Typical contents of foundation/
1. `Theme` / styling system (colors, typography, spacing tokens, design system primitives).
2. `UI primitives` (buttons, inputs, layout components before feature-specific components).
3. `Utilities` / hooks (e.g. useMediaQuery, useLocalStorage).
4. `Global providers` (e.g. theme provider, query client provider).


### Purpose
1. Centralize cross-cutting concerns that every part of the app can safely depend on.
2. Keep “feature” code (like user/, orders/) separated from infrastructure-level code.
3. Avoid circular dependencies — features can import from foundation, but foundation doesn’t import from features.

### Short definition:
foundation/ is where you put the core, low-level pieces that form the base of your application
— styling, primitives, and utilities that everything else builds on.
